# Graph Neural Networks Practice
Following the increasing attention on and improvement of graph neural networks in various domains, this repository aims to catch up many existing GNN variants without complicated codes and experiments. 

Codes are implemented with [PyTorch](pytorch.org) and [DGL](https://docs.dgl.ai/index.html). For DGL, you can find kind tutorial on the official website.
